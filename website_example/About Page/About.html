					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
						The main purpose of the Splunk Capture the Flag (CTF) Environment project is to create a product which is to be used as an introductory or basic level training tool for new Security Analysist hired by the client.  The new employees will be given access to the product prior to starting their new position, allowing them to gain valuable knowledge required within their new role.  From this, the expected benefits of the Splunk CTF Environment will include employees attaining a greater understanding of their responsibilities and what is expected of them as a Security Analysist.  It will also offer them the opportunity to develop their independent working and problem-solving skills, which are skills that will benefit them throughout their career.
