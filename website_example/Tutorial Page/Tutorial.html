						In this quiz, you will be presented with 10 questions. These will come in the form of short answer and multiple-choice questions and your answers will be presented as an overall score when the quiz has been completed. Each question will have a hint provided to you if you are unsure where to start. To complete these questions, you should have access to Splunk Enterprise and have the dataset provided added to Splunk. The download link for Splunk Enterprise and the dataset can be found here:

							Before you undertake the quiz, a few example questions have been provided. These will provide you with insight of how the quiz is structured and provide a basic example of how to search in Splunk. The example questions are as follows:

						<h2>
							QUESTION 1:
						</h2>
						<p>
							How many simulation games were sold?
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Step 1: To begin searching, first ensure that the filter at the top right has been set to “All time” and enter “*” in the search bar to display all results.
						</p>
						<br>

						<br>
						<p>
							Step 2: By browsing the fields at the left-hand side, you can deduce what filter may be needed to narrow down the search.

						<br>
						<P>
							Step 3: For this first question, the output can easily be found by selecting the “categoryID” filter and making “SIMULATION” its value. The Input should look this this:

					<h2>
						QUESTION 2:
					</h2>
					<p>
						What is the first IP address that gave an incorrect password?
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						This question requires the use of the pipe symbol. Firstly, you must search for all entries pertaining to failed passwords, this can be carried out using “fail* password”. After carrying out this search, it can be deduced that the output is in descending order therefore to identify the first address more easily, a pipe can be used followed by “reverse” which will put the output into ascending order. The input should now look like this:
					</p>
					<img src="../Images/q2_1.png"/>
					<br>
					<img src="../Images/q2_2.png"/>
					<br>
					<img src="../Images/q2_3.png"/>
					<br>
					<img src="../Images/q2_4.png"/>
					<br>
					<p>
						Answer: 118.142.68.222

						QUESTION 3:
					</h2>
					<p>
						What is the number of accesses for GET from any IP address which starts with 81?
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Similar to the input for question 2, a pipe will also be required to carry out this operation. The first part of the input will be a simply “get” search, the next part will require knowledge of regular expression. For more information on regular expression, follow the link below:

					<br>
					<p>
						To find all IP addresses beginning with 81, use “regex_raw” followed by the regular expression for the IP addresses, “81\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}". The input should look like this:
